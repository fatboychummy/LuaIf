# LuaIf
Are you tired of writing *boring* if statements?

Are you tired of being *forced* to put `end` to close them?

Are you tired of how *efficient* if statements are normally in Lua?

Well now, you can completely ignore all good coding practices, and use my amazing module!

## Features:

* Absolutely zero (0) if statements! Who the fuck uses 'em anyways?

* Horribly inefficient code!

  * We allocate a variable for every if, then, and else statement you use!

* Potential bugs!

* No need to use an end!

## Possible things you may achieve from using this:

* Godhood!

  * Seriously, if you use this people will think you are a God because only you can understand the code (well, sometimes)!

* Satisfaction!

  * With no need for those pesky ends, you can always rest assured that we will end it all for you.

## Usage:

1. Download the file and put it in the same folder as your program

2. At the top of your file, simply type `local If = require "If"`, and bang, you've got some new, fancy If statements.


## Check the `example.lua` file for an example!
